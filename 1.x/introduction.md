## Laravel Jetstream

Laravel Jetstream is a beautifully designed application scaffolding for Laravel. Jetstream provides the perfect starting point for your next Laravel application and includes login, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session management, API support via [Laravel Sanctum](https://github.com/laravel/sanctum), and optional team management.

Jetstream is designed using Tailwind CSS and offers your choice of [Livewire](./stacks/livewire.md) or [Inertia](./stacks/inertia.md) scaffolding.

## Available Stacks

Laravel Jetstream offers your choice of two frontend stacks: [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com) and [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com). Each stack provides a productive, powerful starting point for building your application; however, the stack you choose will depend on your preferred templating language.

### Livewire + Blade

Laravel Livewire is a library that makes it simple to build modern, reactive, dynamic interfaces using Laravel Blade as your templating language. This is a great stack to choose if you want to build an application that is dynamic and reactive but don't feel comfortable jumping into a full JavaScript framework like Vue.js.

When using Livewire, you may pick and choose which portions of your application will be a Livewire component, while the remainder of your application can be rendered as the traditional Blade templates you are used to.

### Inertia.js + Vue

The Inertia.js stack provided by Jetstream uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) as its templating language. Building an Inertia application is a lot like building a typical Vue application; however, you will use Laravel's router instead of Vue router. Inertia is a small library that allows you to render single-file Vue components from your Laravel backend by providing the name of the component and the data that should be hydrated into that component's "props" like this.

```{js}
Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'verified'])->get('/edit', function () {
    return Inertia\Inertia::render('Edit', [
        'testing_props' => 'This is prop testing'
    ]);
})->name('edit');
```
Then in your Vue page (Edit.vue) you can do like this:

```{js}
<template>
  <h1>This props {{ testing_props }} is from Laravel routes</h1>
</template>
<script>


export default {
  components: {
    //your components
  },

  props: ['testing_props']
};
</script>

```

In other words, this stack gives you the full power of Vue.js without the complexity of client-side routing. You get to use the standard Laravel router that you are used to.

The Inertia stack is a great choice if you are comfortable with and enjoy using Vue.js as your templating language.
